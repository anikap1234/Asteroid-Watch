# Asteroid-Watch

Asteroid Watch is a web application that tracks Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and provides close approach data of asteroids that might pose a potential threat to Earth. This project uses NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API to fetch real-time asteroid data and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.

Features : 
Track Near-Earth Objects (NEOs): Fetch and store general information about NEOs, including their name, size, and potential hazard level.
Close Approach Data: Track close approach events for NEOs, including the approach date, relative velocity, and miss distance from Earth.
User Alerts: Send alerts to users for specific NEOs based on their close approach data.
User Management: Allow users to sign up, log in, and receive personalized asteroid alerts

Tech Stack:
Frontend - html,css,javascript,three.js 
Backend- python,flask, NASA'S NEO API
Databse - postgreSQL,psycop2g
